🗨️ Purpose of This Private Self-Hosted Chat Program
This project is a secure, customizable, and extensible chat system designed for private use — ideal for teams, communities, or individuals who want full control over their communication infrastructure.
🔐 Why Self-Hosted?
Unlike public platforms, this chat system:
- Keeps all data local — no third-party servers involved
- Offers full transparency over how messages and files are handled
- Enables custom moderation tools and admin privileges
🧰 Key Features
- Client and Admin Panels built with Python and Tkinter
- Real-time messaging with timestamps, user IDs, and file sharing
- Admin controls to:
- Delete or edit messages
- Rename users
- Disconnect users remotely
- AI Assistant Panel (deleted)
- Unique user IDs assigned at login for traceability
🧑‍💼 Who Is It For?
- Developers who want a lightweight, hackable chat system
- Educators or researchers building controlled communication environments
- Small teams needing internal messaging without external dependencies
- Privacy-conscious users who want to avoid cloud-based platforms
🚀 Why It Stands Out
- Fully written in Python — easy to audit, extend, and deploy
- Modular design: server, client, admin
